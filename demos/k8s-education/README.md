# Kubernetes Education Video Series

A trilogy of short, visual explanations of core Kubernetes concepts for technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🎬 Videos

### Video 1: What Are Containers? (45 seconds)
**File**: `video1-container-concept-final.mp4` (14 MB)

Explains containers using the shipping container analogy. Features:
- 3D container visualization with advanced CSS animations
- Demonstrates isolation, portability, and packaging concepts
- Perfect introduction for anyone new to containerization

**Key Concepts**:
- Containers package code with all dependencies
- Isolated from other applications
- Run consistently anywhere (dev, staging, production)

---

### Video 2: What Is a Pod? (60 seconds)
**File**: `video2-pod-concept-final.mp4` (27 MB)

Explains Kubernetes Pods using the "roommates sharing an apartment" analogy. Features:
- Glassmorphism design with multiple containers inside one pod
- Animated network connections showing communication
- Shared storage visualization

**Key Concepts**:
- Pods are the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- Multiple containers can share network and storage
- Containers in a pod are scheduled together
- They scale as a single unit

### Video 3: Orchestration Magic (65 seconds)
**File**: `video3-orchestration-final.mp4` (21 MB)

Demonstrates Kubernetes orchestration capabilities. Features:
- Control plane visualization with scheduler, controller, API server, etcd
- Self-healing animation (crash → detect → replace)
- Auto-scaling visualization
- Rolling update wave showing zero-downtime deployments

**Key Concepts**:
- Self-healing: Automatically replaces failed pods
- Auto-scaling: Responds to traffic changes automatically
- Rolling updates: Deploy new versions with zero downtime
- Declarative state: You define what you want, Kubernetes maintains it
