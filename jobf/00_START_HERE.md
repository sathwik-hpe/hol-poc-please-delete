## 🎯 INTERVIEW STRATEGY

### Opening Statement:
"I'm a Senior Cloud Developer with 6 years architecting enterprise-scale cloud infrastructure. At HPE, I was the core developer for platform infrastructure that enabled a $1 billion DISA contract. I've managed 900+ service deployments across distributed Kubernetes environments and reduced system recovery time by 89% through innovative automation.

What excites me about Fidelity's Cloud Network role is the opportunity to apply my platform engineering expertise specifically to network infrastructure automation. I've built self-service platforms, implemented infrastructure-as-code, and solved complex distributed systems problems at scale. I'm ready to bring that experience to network automation in financial services."

### Key Talking Points:

**On Python:**
"I've developed Python RESTful APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and automation scripts. While I've also worked extensively with Go and Java, my Python experience includes [specific example]. The OOP principles are the same across languages - I'm actively expanding my Python development."

**On AWS Networking:**
"I have AWS VPC experience from my platform work at HPE and my Amazon internship. I've designed multi-cluster networking with Istio service mesh, which maps directly to AWS VPC concepts - security groups are like Kubernetes network policies, route tables are like service mesh routing rules. I've supported a $1B contract with strict networking requirements."

**On Terraform:**
"I use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and I'm currently building reusable modules for our platform components. I've also worked extensively with Ansible, and I'm migrating some of those playbooks to Terraform to improve modularity and reusability."

**On Enterprise Scale:**
"I've worked at enterprise scale - 900+ services, 99.9%+ availability, Fortune 500 customers, government contracts. I understand the operational rigor needed in highly regulated environments."
